## ðŸ§­ Section 1: Introduction

This project was developed for the Machine Learning course at LUISS. As newly appointed librarians of the Great Library of Alexandria, our mission is to automatically classify ancient digitized texts by their font style, in order to support the digital archiving process. 

We built a deep learning model capable of identifying writing styles from historical scanned documents, dealing with challenges like image noise, font variation, and dataset imbalance. The final objective is to automate the annotation of historical documents based on their font.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of over 1,000 scanned pages of ancient texts, each labeled with the font used. The files are stored in a CSV (`pages.csv`) referencing image files in the `img/` directory.

### 2.1 Data Integrity Check & Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Existence Verification**  
  We added an `exist` column to our DataFrame that flags whether each image file is present on disk. Any entry with `exist == False` was dropped before further processing.
- **Font Label Mapping**  
  We extracted the unique font names from the datasetâ€™s second column and created a dictionary to map each font to an integer label. In total, we identified **11 distinct fonts**, for example:
  ```python
  font_to_label = {
      'cicero': 0,
      'vesta': 1,
      'senatus': 2,
      'trajan': 3,
      # ... up to 11 entries
  }

### 2.2 Preprocessing
We applied several preprocessing steps to improve image quality and prepare data for training:
- Grayscale conversion
- Image resizing (224x224)
- Binarization (Otsu's method)
- Normalization
- Removal of unreadable pages
